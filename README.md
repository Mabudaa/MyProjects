# About
My name is **Sibusiso Mudamburi**, and I hold of a Bachelor's degree in Informatics. A few year back, I participated in a coidng program organized by **Emzini-WE-Code**, where I completed an *Introduction to Python* course. The curriculum was based on UC Berkeley's CS7 Python Introduction course using the book [Composing Programs](https://composingprograms.com), and it played a pivotal role in sparking my love for Python programming Projects we did in that course you can find inside [Other Projects](./other_projects). Since then, I have built a wide range of personal and experimental projects, many of which are written in Python. These Projects, until now, have been stored locally, and I' finally making the effort to upload and organize them here for easier sharing and versioning. Apologies for that.

## Current Interests and Goals
I am currently focused on **data science**, **AI powered systems**, **automation through intelligent systems** and also finishing up a few projects and collaborations

As I look ahead, I am preparing for graduate studies in **Data Science**. My goal is to deepen my technical expertise and apply it toward building scalable, impactful solutions, especially ones that bring innovative change to Zimbabwe and the broader world tech landscape

## My Projects
This repository is a collection of those projects, and I hope they reflect both my technical growth and dedication to continuous learning

 - [Dyslexia](./dyslexia): A game based system that detects signs of dsylexia in child's handwriting using computer vision and prompts. Inspired by the novel, **"Canaries Among US."** 
 - [Trading Bot App](./trading_bot_app): A mobile app connects to a automated trading system that uses a Flask API and a machine learning model to execute trades based on trends and signal.
 - [Trading Bot Back-End](./trading_bot_loop): This is the trading systems back_end
 - [Data Analysis Projects](./data_analysis_projects)
 - [Other Projects](./other_projects)
 - Architecting **Kreis** , a context-aware AI driven digital signage advertising platform that reacts to real-world stimuli and human presence
> Due to signed NDAs and intellectual property considerations, I am **not able to share the source code or architecture** of *Kreis*. However, I am happy to discuss the conceptual framework and vision behind it
