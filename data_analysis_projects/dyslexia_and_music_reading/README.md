# **Dyslexia and Music Notes Analysis**
The origin project you can find at [link](https://github.com/xShaimaa/Data-Analysis-Projects). I came across it and I fell in love with because it was in alignment with my approach to detection of detection of dyslexia through handwriting analysis.

## Overview
Dyslexia affects approximately 5–10% of children globally. It is marked by challenges in reading fluency and phonological processing, often leading to notable academic and social difficulties. Music-based interventions have been explored as a promising approach for supporting individuals with dyslexia, as they engage cognitive functions—such as phonological awareness and auditory memory—that are commonly impaired in the condition.

## Paper Summary
The study by David Gómez Oropeza et al. (2021) explores how variations in music notation design affect the readability of music for children with dyslexia. Specifically, it compares the traditional notation system with a newly developed alternative inspired by the Gestalt principles of perception. The findings indicate that the redesigned notation system significantly enhances readability for dyslexic learners.

The research examines the correlation between music notation design and the frequency of errors made by both dyslexic and non-dyslexic children when reading music. Using a publicly available dataset and a sample of children with and without dyslexia, the authors assessed the impact of each notation style on reading accuracy.

## Findings
The study revealed that children with dyslexia made substantially more errors than their non-dyslexic peers when reading music using traditional notation. In contrast, their performance improved noticeably when using a redesigned notation system grounded in the Gestalt principles of perception.

Based on these findings, the authors conclude that the visual design of music notation plays a critical role in its readability, particularly for children with dyslexia. They advocate for more intuitive and accessible notation systems that accommodate diverse learning needs, promoting inclusivity in music education.

### Key Observations

 - Dyslexic students made the **most mistakes** on average (18.76), followed by students with learning difficulties (11.08).
 - Non-dyslexic students had the **lowest average mistake count** (9.31).
 - The percentage of students who reported **difficulties reading music** was highest among dyslexic students (71.4%).
- Dyslexic students also showed the **highest percentage  of general reading/writing difficulties** (83.3%).
 - Surprisingly, dyslexic students also had a relatively high rate of playing music (55.6%).

 These trends align with the paper's findings that notation design affects readability and dyslexic learners benefit from better visual structuring.
